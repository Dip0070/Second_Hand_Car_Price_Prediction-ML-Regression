# Second Hand Car Price Prediction
## Overview
Welcome to the Second Hand Car Price Prediction project! This repository is dedicated to predicting the prices of second-hand cars using regression analysis. The project involves understanding the variables through basic data exploration, cleaning and preprocessing of data, visualizing and statistically exploring the data, and building a Python model for regression analysis. Multiple regression algorithms with various hyperparameters are experimented with, aiming to achieve the highest goodness of fit model. The XG-Boost algorithm, with a 91% accuracy by MAPE test, is selected for deployment. The model is deployed using Streamlit in PyCharm software, creating a local website for testing.

33 Introduction
The Second Hand Car Price Prediction project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars. The process involves a comprehensive understanding of variables, data exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, and the development of a regression model for accurate predictions.

## Data Exploration
Explore the variables through basic data exploration techniques to gain insights into the dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is ready for further analysis and model development.

## Visual and Statistical EDA
Visualize and perform statistical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns and relationships in the data.

## Regression Model
Build a Python model for regression analysis, trying multiple regression algorithms with various hyperparameters.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models and select the one with the highest goodness of fit, using metrics such as R-Squared and MAPE test.

## Deployment
Deploy the selected model, powered by the XG-Boost algorithm, using Streamlit in PyCharm software. This creates a local website for testing and interaction.
